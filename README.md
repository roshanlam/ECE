# ECE

ECE Stands for Electron Code Editor. I created to practice working with electron since it has been a while since I have used Electron to create anything. If you think there should be some features in this code editor that you would then feel free fork it and improve this code editor. Please be sure to do a pull request if you have added some awesome features to it.
